                                               Static keyword

A static data member is shared across all objects of the class.

Stored in global memory (not inside objects).
Only one copy exists, shared by all instances.
Can be accessed even without an object.

To access a variable without creating an object .
If we declare a static method inside a class it can;t access any non static member , and yes we can't use this keyword.
