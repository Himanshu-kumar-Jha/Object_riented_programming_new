                                                 Encapsulation 
Encapsulation in OOPs (C++)
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the practice of binding data (variables) and the code (methods) that manipulates the data into a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation helps in data hiding, ensuring that the internal details of an object are not exposed directly but accessed through controlled mechanisms.

By making all of the data members as private.

Key Points of Encapsulation in C++:
Data Hiding: Member variables are made private or protected to restrict direct access from outside the class.
Getter and Setter Methods: Public methods are used to provide controlled access to private data.
Improved Security: Prevents unintended modifications to data.
Better Code Maintenance: Changes in internal implementation do not affect external code using the class.
