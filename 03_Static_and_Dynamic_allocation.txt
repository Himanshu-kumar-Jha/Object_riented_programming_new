Static and dynamic allocation of memory of objects 

Dynamic allocation of memory for an object has several benefits:

Flexibility:

You can allocate memory at runtime based on the program's needs, which is useful when the size or number of objects is not known at compile time.

Efficient Memory Usage:
Memory is allocated only when needed and can be deallocated when no longer required, which can lead to more efficient use of memory.

Lifetime Control:
Dynamically allocated objects can have a lifetime that extends beyond the scope in which they were created. This is useful for objects that need to persist across multiple function calls or throughout the program's execution.

Avoiding Stack Overflow:
Large objects or a large number of objects can consume significant stack space, leading to stack overflow. Dynamic allocation uses the heap, which typically has more available memory than the stack.

Polymorphism and Inheritance:
Dynamic allocation is often used in conjunction with polymorphism and inheritance. For example, you can allocate memory for a base class pointer and assign it to a derived class object, enabling runtime polymorphism.
